Thanks for contributing to this project.

Everytime you open an issue please state which version of Laravel are you using and which version of this package are you using.
This is very important so that problems can be issued quicker.


Please ensure that you run `phpunit` from the project root after you've made any changes.

If you've added something new please create a new unit test, if you've changed something please update any unit tests as appropritate.

We're trying to ensure there is **100%** test code coverage (including testing PHP errors and exceptions) so please ensure any new/updated tests cover all of your changes.

Thank you,

@lucadegasperi
